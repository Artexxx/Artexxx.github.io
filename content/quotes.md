A collection of quotes and musings

## Quotes

> "There is no 'us' and 'them'; it's an illusion.  We are all human beings, and we all have a responsibility to support one another and to discover ways of wresting the power from the very, very few people who control all the cash and all the property."

> "Everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon."

> "Long you live and high you fly. And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry. And all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be."

---

> "You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish.  I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be.  It's their mistake, not my failing."

\- Dwight D. Eisenhower
{{</typeit>}}

---

> "Most rules lie, yet lies are less shocking, less corrosive than the chosen, cultivated ignorance that Chevallier addresses here.  This ignorance denies the reality of anything which provokes pity.  It is an error to think of such war leaders or, today, economic strategists, as pitiless.  They are abject.  This is what we have to learn and to act upon.  They are abject."

\- Gabriel Chevallier, Fear; A Novel of World War I (Quote from Roger Waters The Wall, 2015)
{{</typeit>}}

---

---

> "When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."

> "There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die"

> "Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming "Wow! What a Ride!"

> "No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind.  Buy the ticket, take the ride…and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind, well… maybe chalk it off to forced conscious expansion: Tune in, freak out, get beaten."

> "So we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?"

> "Life has become immeasurably better since I have been forced to stop taking it seriously."

> "I was not proud of what I had learned, but I never doubted that it was worth knowing."

> "A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance."

> "Some may never live, but the crazy never die."

> "We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and—in spite of True Romance magazines—we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company,
we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely—at least, not all the time—but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important,
and I don't see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness."

{{< typeit group=paragraph >}}
\- Neil Gaiman
